Animated-Expanding-ListView
===========================

Animated Expanding ListView provides a fancy animation on expanding or collapsing the content of a listview item.

It works in all version of Android and it's very easy to adapt to your project.

## How to use with Gradle

Simply add the repository to your build.gradle file:
```groovy
repositories {
	jcenter()
	maven { url 'https://github.com/leonardocardoso/mvn-repo/raw/master/maven-deploy' }
}
```

And you can use the artifacts like this:
```groovy
dependencies {
	compile 'com.leocardz:aelv:1.1@aar'
	// ...
}
```


## Important
<ul>
    <li> Your list adapter must extend <b>ArrayAdapter&lt;? yourListItem ?&gt;</b> </li>
    <li> Your listview item must extend from AelvListItem
        <ul>
            <li> Right after you create your listview item, you need to call <b>yourItem.setUp(int collapsedHeight, int currentHeight, int expandedHeight, boolean isOpen);</b> to setup the dimensions.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Your listview item view holder must extend from AelvListViewHolder
        <ul>
            <li> Right after you instantiate your view holder you need to call <b>yourHolder.setViewWrap(viewWrap)</b>; and tell adapter that you are updating the item size calling <b>holder.getViewWrap().setLayoutParams(new AbsListView.LayoutParams(AbsListView.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, listItem.getCurrentHeight()));</b>.</li>
            <li> Right before you return the view on your custom adapter, you must call <b>yourItem.setHolder(yourHolder)</b>;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You need to instantiate <b>Aelv aelv = new Aelv(isAccordion, animationDuration, yourListItems, yourListView, yourAdapter);</b> right after you setup your listview.</li>
    <li>Last thing: your must implement <b>listview.setOnItemClickListener();</b> and insert this <b>aelv.toggle(view, position);</b> inside the listener and voil√†!</li>
</ul>

Just check the app example to see it clearly.
